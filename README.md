**Physics Sandbox**
Inspired by games like Line Rider, in July of 2025, I coded this bad boy up to simulate an object rolling down a path defined by the user, all with customizable gravity, friction, and air resistance.
Admittedly, the collision mechanics are quite janky and inefficient, but I had fun and I hope you do too!
